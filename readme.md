# Client.Express.js
  
  This is an API implementation of Express.js (for Node.js) but intended to run on the client instead. This is heavily inspired by Express.js and Davis.js and much code of these libraries is re-used here.
  
  Express.js: https://github.com/visionmedia/express
  Davis.js: https://github.com/olivernn/davis.js
  
# Example

  You will need to have Node.js installed then just execute:
  
  $ node example/server.js
